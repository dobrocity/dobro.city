    <p>
      Dobro Wallet ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your
      privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard
      your information when you use our open-source Stellar wallet application.
    </p>

    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
    <p>
      Our wallet is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal
      information necessary for the wallet's operation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Public Stellar addresses</li>
      <li>
        Transaction data that is publicly available on the Stellar network
      </li>
      <li>Basic device information required for the wallet to function</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
    <p>The information we collect is used solely for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitating transactions on the Stellar network</li>
      <li>Displaying your wallet balance and transaction history</li>
      <li>Improving wallet functionality and user experience</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <p>
      Your private keys and sensitive wallet data are stored locally on your
      device. We do not store or have access to your:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Private keys</li>
      <li>Recovery phrases</li>
      <li>Passwords</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
      Our wallet interacts with the Stellar network and may connect to
      Stellar-related services. These interactions are necessary for wallet
      functionality but are governed by the public nature of blockchain
      technology.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Source Commitment</h3>
    <p>
      As an open-source project, our code is publicly available for review. We
      believe in transparency and encourage users to verify our privacy
      practices through code inspection.
    </p>

    <h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify users of
      any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date.
